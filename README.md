# Speech Examples
On my paper "What are the technical challenges in creating human-like speech for virtual voice assistants, and how can these challenges be overcome?", we explore opportunities for overcoming technical challenges in creating more human-like speech for virtual voice assistants. Specifically, we investigate the key characteristics of human speech that contribute to perceived naturalness. We also examine the key technical challenges in creating human-like speech for virtual voice assistants. We examine the technology behind Virtual Voice Assistants and how their various elements work together to create a useful multidisciplinary tool.  After that,  we will go over key techniques of creating human-like speeches.  At the end we discuss the results of a survey we conducted about current Text-to-Speech services speech examples. Using the data from our survey, we conducted Mean Opinion Score tests to assess the perceived human-likeness of selected speech examples. Through I will share the examples here. You can listen them also by giving points you can compere your points with average too.
